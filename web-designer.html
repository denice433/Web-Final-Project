    <h2>Web Design Experience</h2>
    <p>
      My experience in web design has taught me how creative and rewarding it can be to build something from the ground up. I still consider myself a beginner. I learned simple HTML and CSS, and I was amazed at how you could build a webpage just by typing code. These helped me understand how to use colors, fonts, and layout techniques to make a page look more professional. I also learned how to make a website work well on both computers and phones by using responsive design. Web design has taught me a lot about creativity, problem-solving, and paying attention to detail. I’m still learning, but I enjoy the process and want to keep getting better.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Learning the web design process has been a fun and challenging experience. At first, I didn’t know much about how websites were built. It was frustrating when things didn’t look right, but I learned to check my code and make small changes to fix problems. The web design process taught me not only technical skills, but also patience and creativity. I’m proud of what I was able to create, and I’m excited to keep learning more about design and coding in the future.
